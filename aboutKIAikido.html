    <section id="About Ki Aikido">
        <h2>About Ki Aikido</h2>
        <p>The Ki Federation of Great Britain emphasises the awareness and understanding of Ki both in our practice and our daily lives. The prefix “Ki” is used to show this emphasis in our Aikido practice.</p>
        <p>Ki Aikido is a unique martial art with a philosophy that emphasizes harmony, self-defense, and personal growth. Here are some reasons why people choose Aikido:

        <h3>1. **Non-aggressive approach**:</h3> 
            <p>Ki Aikido focuses on neutralizing an opponent's attack without causing harm. Instead of direct confrontation, practitioners blend with the attacker's energy, using their force against them.</p>
            
        <h3>2. **Self-defense without aggression**:</h3>
            <p>Ki Aikido teaches effective self-defense techniques that do not rely on brute strength. It's ideal for people of all ages, sizes, and physical abilities because the emphasis is on using leverage and timing rather than physical power.</p>
            
        <h3>3. **Philosophy of peace and harmony**:</h3> 
            <p>The art encourages practitioners to resolve conflict peacefully. It's deeply rooted in the idea of maintaining harmony within oneself and with others, making it as much a mental and spiritual practice as a physical one.</p>
        <h3>4. **Physical and mental benefits**:</h3> 
            <p>Ki Aikido improves coordination, balance, flexibility, and strength. Mentally, it promotes mindfulness, discipline, and stress reduction, helping practitioners develop calmness in both martial and everyday situations.
            </p>
        <h3>5. **Focus on personal growth**:</h3> 
            <p>Ki Aikido is more than just a martial art—it's a lifelong journey of self-improvement. The art's emphasis on constant learning and refining techniques encourages personal growth and self-awareness.
            </p>
            <p>Overall, people choose Ki Aikido for its balance between physical training, mental discipline, and its philosophy of peaceful conflict resolution.</p>
